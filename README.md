# mikro-orm-attachments

`mikro-orm-attachments` is a plugin for [MikroORM](https://mikro-orm.io/) that adds powerful, type-safe file and image attachment support to your entities. It supports variants (transforms, thumbnails, etc), blurhash, custom storage drivers (via [flydrive](https://github.com/flydrive/core)), and declarative attachment columns.

## Features

-   📂 Attach files and images to MikroORM entities
-   🖼 Supports variants (e.g., thumbnails, webp, custom transforms)
-   🤏 Generates blurhash for fast image previews
-   💾 Storage abstraction via Flydrive (local, S3, etc.)
-   🔄 Custom converters and pipeline transforms
-   🔥 TypeScript-first & type-safe

---

## Installation

```sh
npm install mikro-orm-attachments flydrive
# If you want blurhash & image variants:
npm install sharp blurhash
```

---

## Quick Start

### 1. Create the Attachment-Service (Mikro-ORM Subscriber)

```ts
import { AttachmentSubscriber } from "mikro-orm-attachments";

const attachmentSubscriber = new AttachmentSubscriber({
	drivers: {
		fs: new FSDriver({
			location: "./uploads",
			urlBuilder: {
				async generateURL(key, filePath) {
					return `http://localhost:3000/uploads/${key}`;
				},
			},
		}),
	},
	defaultDriver: "fs",
});

export const AttachmentProperty = attachmentSubscriber.AttachmentDecorator;
```

### 2. Define an Entity with an Attachment

```ts
import { Entity, PrimaryKey, Property } from "@mikro-orm/core";
import { Attachment } from "mikro-orm-attachments";
import { AttachmentProperty } from "./attachmentSubscriber";

@Entity()
export class Project {
	@PrimaryKey()
	id!: number;

	@Property()
	name!: string;

	@AttachmentProperty()
	avatar!: Attachment;
}
```

### 3. Use the subscriber in your MikroORM Config

In your MikroORM config:

```ts
import { MikroORM } from "@mikro-orm/core";
import { attachmentSubscriber } from "./attachmentSubscriber";

const orm = await MikroORM.init({
	// ... your config,
	subscribers: [attachmentSubscriber],
});
```

---

## Usage

### Attaching a File

You can set entity attachments by assigning a File-like object:

```ts
import { Attachment } from "mikro-orm-attachments";

const project = orm.em.create(Project, {
	name: "My App",
	avatar: Attachment.fromFile(fileStream),
});
await orm.em.persist(project).flush(); // flush before using. Image gets uploaded and resized in this step.

// avatar column will be persisted: includes URL, size, variants, etc.
```

### Accessing Attachment Metadata

```ts
console.log(project.avatar.url()); // download URL (from urlBuilder)
console.log(project.avatar.getStream()); // File-Stream
```

### Deleting & Replacing Attachments

When you hard-delete an entity (`em.remove(entity)` + `em.flush()`), the plugin automatically deletes
the attachment's underlying files (the original + every generated variant) from storage.

The same cleanup happens when you **replace** an attachment on an existing entity — assign a new file
(or `null`) to the property and flush — the previously stored original + variants are deleted once the
update succeeds:

```ts
project.avatar = Attachment.fromFile(newFile); // or: project.avatar = null;
await orm.em.flush(); // old avatar's files are deleted from storage after the update commits
```

Both are best-effort: if a storage delete fails (network error, permissions, etc.), it's logged as a
warning and the entity change still completes — a storage error will never roll back your transaction.

**Limitation:** this only works for entities changed through MikroORM's normal persist lifecycle
(`em.persist()`/`em.remove()` + flush). Soft-delete patterns (setting a `deletedAt` column instead of
calling `em.remove()`) and raw `em.nativeUpdate()`/`em.nativeDelete()`/query-builder writes bypass
entity hooks and will **not** trigger file cleanup — you're responsible for cleaning up storage
yourself in those cases.

## Advanced Features

### Variants

Variants allow you to automatically create different versions of an attachment (thumbnails, webp, etc):

**Example:**

```ts
@AttachmentProperty({
  driver: "fs",
  variants: {
    thumbnail: {
      format: "jpeg",
      resize: { width: 64, height: 64 }
    },
    webp: {
      format: "webp",
      options: { quality: 70 }
    }
  }
})
avatar!: Attachment<"thumbnail" | "webp">;
```

The plugin will generate and persist all declared variants.
Adding the variant names to the Attachment Generic Type gives you and your team better DX by adding the variants to all Attachment functions
```ts
console.log(project.avatar.url("thumbnail"))
//                                  ^ -- typed, when added manually
```

You can also define global variants, that can be reused inside a single entity.

```ts
export const attachmentSubscriber = new AttachmentSubscriber({
	// ... your config
	variants: {
		thumbnail: {
			resize: {
				height: 100,
			},
			format: {
				format: "webp",
				options: {
					quality: 80,
				},
			},
		},
	},
});
```

To now use this predefined variant, you'll have to add this to your entities config.

```ts
@AttachmentProperty({
	variants: ["thumbnail"]
})
avatar!: Attachment<"thumbnail">;
```

This will automatically apply the global defined rules to this field.

### Blurhash

Fast low-quality image previews are automatically enabled. Read more at [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh).
You can also disable it for your fields.

```ts
@AttachmentProperty({
  blurhash: false, // or set BlurhashOptions
})
avatar!: Attachment;
```

Resulting attachments will include a `.blurhash()` function, that returns the corresponding blurhash string.

## API Reference

### `AttachmentProperty(options)`

Decorator for MikroORM entity properties.

**Options:**

-   `driver`: Optionally select which configured storage to use (`"fs"`, `"s3"`, etc.)
-   `folder`: Folder/name prefix for storage
-   `blurhash`: Enable/disable or configure [Blurhash](https://blurha.sh)
-   `variants`: Object or array of variant specs (resize, format, etc.)

### Attachment Object

Stored in the DB as JSON:

```ts
{
  name: string;
  extname: string;
  size: number;
  drive: string;
  mimeType: string;
  path: string;
  url: string;
  originalName: string;
  blurhash?: string;
  variants: Attachment[];
}
```

---

## Migration

When adding a new attachment column:

1. Add the property using `@AttachmentProperty`.
2. Add a JSON or JSONB column to your DB schema.

---

## FAQ

**Q: How do I upload files in HTTP requests?**

A: Accept file uploads in your framework, parse as a buffer; pass to your entity's attachment property before persist.

**Q: Can I use S3?**

A: Yes! Configure an S3 driver in `drivers` with flydrive.

**Q: Is it type-safe?**

A: Yes! Variants are type-safe and can be passed through by typing the generic `Attachment` Type to provide better DX.
